So if you set a reminder for 29-2-2024 (D-M-Y) and set the reminder to repeat each year, the next reminders will be triggered on 28-2-2025, 28-2-2026, 28-2-2027, 28-2-2028, etc. Notice that even in 2028, when there is a 29<sup>th</sup> day in February, it will still run on the 28<sup>th</sup>. This is because it ran on the 28<sup>th</sup> the previous year, so add one year to it and it will run on the 28<sup>th</sup> again.</p> <p>Instead of repeating based on a certain time interval, it is also possible to repeat based on the week days. Select 'Week Days' when creating a reminder and select the days of the week that you want the reminder to trigger on. For example, if you select 'Mo' and 'Thu', the reminder will be triggered every Monday and Thursday. The time is based on the time set.
